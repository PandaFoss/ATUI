_**Note:** ATUI is in a very early stage of development. We are not responsible for any inconvenience that may arise from its use or implementation, in whole or in part._

## About this project

If you want to escape distributions with complex desktop environments and a hundred applications that demand too many hardware resources to perform a simple task, perhaps ATUI is your best option. We take `archiso` as a base and from there we are modeling a mini distribution that complies with the KISS philosophy and perfectly executes daily tasks such as editing text documents, browsing the web or playing simple games. Of course, all through a _terminal user interface_.
